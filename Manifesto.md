# DAO TON CON
### Manifesto. Principles. Tokenomics

DAO TON CON is a events DAO on The Open Network. Each NFT for the participant, which confirms the information about the DAO membership. Each time you participate in an DAO, TON DAO send a unique NFT, which is verified by a cryptographic record. These NFT are Non-Fungible Tokens and contain all information about the DAO.

## DAO TON CON Manifesto
The manifesto is published on Web 3.0 networks in the public domain and has legal force throughout the space-time known to people.
The manifesto can be supplemented, changed at the initiative of the DAO participants.
We agree that the Metaverse is only a part of the common reality of people, but can be closely connected with it.


The purpose of the DAO is to organize and conduct educational and creative events in the digital environment and in physical reality.

## Principles of participation in DAO
1. Creation. It is the nature of people to create. We can do it unconsciously or consciously. The latter allows us to choose the future in which we want to live. Any creative unit of the Metaverse is equal to Sovereign.
2. Awareness. Life, work, people - everything in order to learn more about yourself. Who am I as a member? Who am I as a co-author? Who am I in this life and at this moment? Who am I like life?
3. Improvement. Places, yourself, things. The world strives for natural efficiency. We strive for the same, to be in harmony with the world.
4. Honesty. In front of yourself, in front of others. Deception (special or not) has a reason. These reasons should become known (first of all to oneself).
5. Work. Creation and creativity are accompanied by actions. Action leads to real change. We try to be the cause and not the effect in life. The easiest and most understandable way to do this is through work.
6. Knowledge and learning. There is always something we don't know. There is always something we can learn. There is always someone we can learn from. Each person is both a student and a teacher. Knowledge and experience are primary, profit and income are secondary.
7. Give away. We can do more than we think. To take is common to many, to give - you need to learn.
8. Now. This moment of the present is the only thing we have at our disposal. Don't put off what you can do now.
9. Cooperation. Together we can benefit each other and the whole world. You just need to find: a) how and b) what prevents you from doing it.
10. Be the cause of. Change the world, actively participate in the life of the community and society, and not remain a consequence of circumstances.

## Tokenomics

NFTs DAO TON CON is the key to the community, some types of NFTs also prove ownership of common property (eg exhibition halls, galleries, etc.). At first, it can be a shared ownership of a separate purchased gallery, later it can be scaled to purchased halls. But there is always some common premises that are proof of participation in the DAO.

Tokenomics and participation of people can look like a conditional - the intersection of a horizontal structure and a vertical one: including - within a given volume. Circles in the vertical plane and circles in the horizontal.
